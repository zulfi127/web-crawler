# web-crawler
A web crawl to extract the clean texts of news articles from the website https://www.nytimes.com/ . The main goal of this project is to extract 100 news articles from each chosen topic on New York Times and store them in different text files. I chose to get the articles from the topics World, U.S., New York, Technology, Science, Business, Sports, Health, Arts, and Travel.
